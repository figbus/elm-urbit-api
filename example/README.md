To run:

- Create and run a fake ~zod with `urbit -F zod`
- Be sure to approve localhost for CORS with `|cors-approve 'http://localhost:3000'` within the ship's dojo terminal
- Run `npm install` followed by `npm start`
- Press "Connect" on the newly opened page.

Then, anything you enter will be saved to your local urbit graph store and
persisted across reconnects!
